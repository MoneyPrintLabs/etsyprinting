## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-25

First public release.

### Added

- **Setup that checks as it goes.** `stallkit init` writes `.env` with the shared secret
  typed hidden and verifies the credential against Etsy. `stallkit setup` walks every
  prerequisite and names the single next command; `stallkit doctor` runs the same
  checklist without asking anything, for scripts.
- **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE.** A one-shot `localhost` listener catches the redirect, or you
  paste the address back. Tokens live in `~/.stallkit/token.json` with `0600`
  permissions and refresh themselves, including mid-batch.
- **Bulk listings from a spreadsheet.** `listings template`, `listings pull` and
  `listings push`. An empty `listing_id` creates a draft, a filled one updates. The whole
  file is validated before anything is sent — titles, the 13-tag and 20-character rules,
  enum values, prices, image count, format and size — and one bad row stops the run
  unless `--partial` is given. New listings are always drafts.
- **Orders and tracking.** `orders pull` exports orders to CSV (`--since`, `--unshipped`),
  `orders carriers` lists valid carrier names per country, and `orders ship` uploads
  tracking in bulk after a dry run and a confirmation.
- **SEO.** `seo audit` scores every listing out of 100, worst first, plus shop-level
  checks for listings competing for the same searches. `seo keywords` samples what
  actually ranks for a term — tags, title phrases, price band — with only a keystring.
  `seo suggest` combines both for one listing.
- **Designs in, drafts out.** `drop init` creates a workspace folder; `drop template`
  copies business settings from a listing you built by hand; `drop run` composites
  loose artwork onto your mockups, researches each concept, writes titles and tags
  within Etsy's limits and produces a `review.csv` without sending anything; `drop auto`
  uploads folders of finished photos as drafts, with an upload history that prevents
  duplicates.
- **Print-area calibration.** `drop calibrate` sets where a design lands on each mockup,
  shares it with every mockup of the same size, imports a pixel-based file, and draws
  the rectangle on the mockup so it can be checked before it is saved.
- **Images that match what the seller sees.** Phone photos are turned upright from their
  EXIF orientation, colour profiles are converted to sRGB, transparent templates are
  flattened onto white, 16-bit greyscale keeps its tone, and JPEGs keep full colour
  resolution. Formats Etsy refuses are converted, and the row says so.
- **`--anonymise`** hides shop name, ids, titles, URLs and tags in terminal output so a
  screenshot can be shared.

### Notes on Etsy's API

Recorded here and in the code so nobody has to re-derive them:

- `x-api-key` must carry **both** the keystring and the shared secret, colon-joined, on
  every request including unauthenticated ones. PKCE removes the client secret from the
  *token exchange* only — not from this header.
- Callback URLs may be `http://` or `https://`, and the host must be a **domain name**.
  `localhost` is accepted; `127.0.0.1` is rejected. Etsy's prose docs say https-only,
  which is narrower than what is enforced and leads you to build the wrong flow.
- Rate limits are **per app**. A Personal Access app gets 5 requests/second and 5,000
  per day — not the 10/sec and 10,000/day the general documentation quotes.
- Array form fields such as `tags` and `materials` are **comma-joined strings**, not
  repeated keys. Repeated keys silently drop all but one value.
- `createDraftListing` takes form encoding; `createReceiptShipment` takes JSON.
- Listing images must be JPG, PNG or GIF, at most 20MB, and at most ten per listing.
- There is no idempotency key, so non-idempotent writes are never retried on a timeout
  or a 5xx — a repeat would mean a duplicate listing, or a second email to a buyer.
