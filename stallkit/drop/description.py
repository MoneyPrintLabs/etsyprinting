"""The description every new draft gets, made from the template listing's own.

A description is prose, and stallkit does not write marketing copy (see
generate.build_description): the seller's own words carry over. But the template
listing's description is about ITS design. Copied as it is, a line naming that listing
and a sentence about its pattern end up on every other design's draft ("a sunny grove
of lemons" on a woodland nursery mural). So:

- The template's own title, wherever its description repeats it, becomes the new draft's
  title, and so does a line made of the title's " | ", ", " or " - " segments ("Sage
  Lemon Wallpaper | Olive Citrus Mural").
- The seller can save a description template on Şablon İlan (product.json,
  `description_template`): the template's description with its title turned into
  {başlık}. {başlık} is each draft's title and {tasarım} its design (the concept read from
  the file name); {title} and {design} are the same placeholders in English.
- A sentence holding a word that names the template's own design (from its title and
  tags: "lemon", "sage"; never a product, room or material word such as "wallpaper",
  "sample" or "kitchen") is flagged: it would be copied onto every draft.

Nothing here talks to Etsy. Offsets are Python string indices (code points).
