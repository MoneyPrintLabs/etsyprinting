ETSY STUDIO
===========

1-MOCKUPS   Put your mockup templates here (photos of a blank shirt, mug, poster).
            You only do this once. If a design lands in the wrong place on one,
            run: stallkit drop calibrate --preview

2-PRODUCTS  Put the designs you want listed here. This is the folder you use every
            time. One loose design = one listing. For ready photos, create one
            folder per product and put its numbered images inside (01, 02, ...).
            Name the folder after the product. Run: stallkit drop auto

            Digital products (a template listing of type download or both):
            a loose design is delivered as the file itself. A product folder
            delivers the files in its dosyalar (or files) subfolder, at most 5,
            each up to 20 MB; its photos stay in the product folder itself.
            Folders inside dosyalar are not sent: zip each into one file.
            A product folder with only a dosyalar folder and no photos stops
            at the check: every listing needs at least one photo.

3-DRAFTS    What comes out: composited images and review.csv.
            `stallkit drop run` stops here so you can check review.csv first.
            `stallkit drop auto` uploads the drafts straight away, in one step.

archive/    Optional manual archive. Files are not moved automatically.

upload-history.json (next to these folders) records every automatic upload.
Keep it: it is what stops `drop auto` from uploading a product twice.

watermark.png and watermark.json (optional; set them on the app's Mockups page or
with `stallkit drop watermark`): your mark, stamped on copies of the listing photos
of digital products (or of every listing). Never on the files buyers download.

Nothing here is ever published. Listings are created as DRAFTS in your Etsy shop
and stay invisible to buyers until you publish them yourself.

1-MOCKUPS   Mockup sablonlarini buraya koy (bos tisort, kupa, poster fotograflari).
            Bunu sadece bir kez yaparsin. Tasarim yanlis yere denk geliyorsa
            komut: stallkit drop calibrate --preview

2-PRODUCTS  Listelemek istedigin tasarimlari buraya koy. Her seferinde
            kullanacagin klasor bu. Hazir mockuplar icin her urune ayri bir klasor
            ac; 01, 02 diye siraladigin resimleri icine koy. Klasore urunun adini
            ver. Komut: stallkit drop auto. Bir urun klasoru = bir listing.

            Dijital urunler (turu download ya da both olan sablon ilan): tek
            basina bir tasarimda alici dosyanin kendisini indirir. Urun
            klasorunde alici, klasorun icindeki dosyalar (ya da files) alt
            klasorundeki dosyalari indirir: en fazla 5 dosya, her biri en fazla
            20 MB. Fotograflar yine urun klasorunun kendisinde durur. dosyalar
            icindeki klasorler gonderilmez: her birini zip'leyip tek dosya yap. Icinde
            yalnizca dosyalar klasoru olan, fotografi olmayan bir urun klasoru
            kontrolde durur: her ilanin en az bir fotografi olmali.

3-DRAFTS    Cikan sonuc: giydirilmis gorseller ve review.csv.
            `stallkit drop run` burada durur; once review.csv'ye bakarsin.
            `stallkit drop auto` ise taslaklari tek adimda hemen yukler.

archive/    Istersen elle arsivleyebilirsin; otomatik tasima yapilmaz.

upload-history.json (bu klasorlerin yaninda) her otomatik yuklemeyi kaydeder.
Silme: `drop auto`nun ayni urunu iki kez yuklemesini engelleyen bu dosya.

watermark.png ve watermark.json (istege bagli; uygulamanin Mockuplar sayfasindan ya da
`stallkit drop watermark` ile ayarlanir): filigraniniz. Dijital urunlerin (ya da tum
ilanlarin) ilan fotograflarinin kopyalarina basilir; alicinin indirdigi dosyalara asla.

Hicbir sey yayinlanmaz. Listingler Etsy magazanda TASLAK olarak olusturulur ve sen
kendin yayinlayana kadar alicilar goremez.
