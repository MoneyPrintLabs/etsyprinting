"""The shop's info images: the pictures every draft ends with.

A shop's listings often close on the same few cards: the materials, the sizes, how to
install, how to order a sample, how to measure. The seller picks them once, on Şablon
İlan (from the template listing's photos on Etsy, or image files of their own), and
every draft stallkit makes gets them after its own photos, in the seller's order, each
with its alt text. They are never watermarked or changed.

They are kept in the workspace as full-resolution copies, so a run needs no Etsy call
for them, and `drop run` / `drop auto` (the CLI) use them exactly as the app does:

    <workspace>/info-images/                    the pictures (JPG, PNG or GIF)
    <workspace>/info-images/info-images.json    first to last:
        {"images": [{"file": "etsy-4401.jpg", "alt": "Materials",
                     "listing_id": 1000013, "listing_image_id": 4401}, ...]}

A picture in the folder that the file does not list (one put there by hand) follows the
listed ones, in name order; an entry whose file is gone is ignored. At most
MAX_INFO_IMAGES are used.

Etsy takes MAX_LISTING_IMAGES (20) pictures per listing (createDraftListing's
`image_ids`, "up to 20 images", in the Open API spec). A draft's own photos come first,
so the mockups a design can use shrink by one per info image (`mockup_cap`, which
`catalog.usage` applies), and a product folder whose photos leave too little room gets
only the info images that fit, the first ones (`fitting`); the run says so.
