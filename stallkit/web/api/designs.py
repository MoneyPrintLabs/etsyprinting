    POST   /api/designs/review/forget  {"name", "confirm": true}: try a product again
    POST   /api/designs/unlock         {"confirm": true}: remove a crashed run's lock

A run creates DRAFTS only; nothing is published. The confirm modal in the page
("Başlat") is the consent for creating them.

A digital template (type download or both) makes digital drafts: each product's
download files go up after its images — a loose design's original file, a folder
product's `dosyalar` / `files` subfolder (drop.pipeline.deliverables). The pending view
says per product what would be attached and what is wrong with it.

A download-only template's drafts show what the buyer gets: of the switched-on mockups
only those that are no physical product (posters, canvases, frames, "other") are used,
plus the flat preview; the pending view names them and the ones left out.

The pending view also says, for the start card:
- per loose design its background (`ground`: transparent | flat | photo, None while not
  read yet): an opaque one goes up as it is unless the seller asks (start's `opaque`) to
  place those on a solid background onto the mockups (drop.stream);
- the template's product as a mockup type (`template.product`) and the main mockup's
  (`mockups.main_type`), so a mug template with a T-shirt main image is pointed out;
- the workspace's watermark (`watermark`: drop.watermark.describe for the template's
  type): whether the run stamps it, and where. A mark that is on but cannot be read
  blocks the start ("watermark"): its photos must never go up without it.

The shop section (the start card's "Mağaza bölümü"): every draft of a run goes into the
section chosen there, whatever the template listing's is. `section` on start:
- "template": the template listing's section, as always. When Etsy no longer has it (the
  seller deleted it), the drafts go into no section instead of failing one by one.
- "none": no section.
- a section id: that section, checked against the shop's sections first; one that is gone
  is 409 section_gone (the page reads the list again).
Left out, the run is what it was before there was a choice (the template's, unchecked).
A real run remembers the choice for the open shop (shop pref `drop_section`); the card
starts on it next time, unless its section is gone. A check (dry run) ignores it.
