"""Ayarlar: the products folder and the setup checklist.

    GET  /api/settings             version, licence, repository, the folders
    POST /api/settings/workspace   {"path": "<absolute folder>" | ""} ("" = the default)
    POST /api/settings/doctor      run the setup checklist (`stallkit doctor`) now

A folder of a workspace (1-MOCKUPS, 2-PRODUCTS, 3-DRAFTS, anything inside them) chosen
as the workspace means that workspace: its root is saved, never a second workspace
nested inside the first (`drop.workspace.root_for`). The answer then carries
`adjusted: {"chosen", "root", "inside"}` so the page can say so (`inside` false: the
folder is only named like one, e.g. a new "...\\2-PRODUCTS", and its parent was used).
A folder saved that way by an older version is reported as `workspace.nested_in` (the
root it belongs to); switching to that root carries the nested workspace's template and
upload history over (`drop.workspace.adopt_nested`), listed in `migrated`.

Language, hiding shop names, the shop list and quitting use the core endpoints
(/api/prefs, /api/shops/*, /api/quit); the Etsy connection uses /api/connect/*.
